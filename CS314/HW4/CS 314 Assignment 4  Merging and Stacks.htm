<h2>CS 314 Assignment 4: Merging and Stacks</h2>

<h3>Due: October 4, 2012.</h3>

<b>Files:</b> <tt>Cons.java</tt>, <tt>Account.java</tt>

<p>
This assignment may be done in Java or in Lisp (except item 2) .
</p><p>

</p><ol>

<li> Write the functions <tt>union</tt> and <tt>setDifference</tt>,
using the merge technique, to perform these functions on sets
represented as lists.  You may use the <tt>llmergesort</tt> function to
sort the lists first.  We will assume that the elements of the
lists support the operations <tt>.compareTo()</tt> and <tt>.equals()</tt>.
<p>

</p></li><li> Write a function <tt>Cons bank(Cons accounts, Cons updates)</tt>
that uses the merge technique to update a list of bank accounts.
Both <tt>accounts</tt> and <tt>updates</tt> have elements of type
<tt>Account</tt>, with access functions <tt>String name()</tt> and
<tt>Integer amount()</tt>.  We will assume that <tt>accounts</tt> is
already sorted by name, but <tt>updates</tt> is not sorted.  A given
name will appear only once in <tt>accounts</tt>, but may have multiple
entries in <tt>updates</tt>.
<p>
The function <tt>bank</tt> should update a customer's bank balance
by adding the amount of each update to it.  The output should be
a new sorted list of accounts with updated balances; make a new
<tt>Account</tt> with the new information.
</p><p>
You will need to write the <tt>.compareTo()</tt> method for an
<tt>Account</tt> to properly sort the updates.  The first criterion
for sorting is the <tt>name</tt>, which should be in alphabetic order.
Within the same <tt>name</tt>, updates must be sorted by <tt>amount</tt>.
In order to avoid falsely signaling overdrafts, the bank must process
all deposits before any withdrawals.  Therefore, any positive
<tt>amount</tt> must be sorted before any negative <tt>amount</tt>.
The bank also wants to sort the negative amounts so that the largest
withdrawals (most negative amounts) are processed first, to cause
the largest possible number of overdrafts and overdraft fees for the
bank.  (Yes, this is evil; but it is what the banks actually have been doing.

)
</p><p>
If there is an overdraft, print a message stating so, with the
name and final amount.  Go ahead and update the account, making the
account balance negative, and subtract <tt>30</tt> from the balance
as an overdraft fee.
</p><p>
If a <tt>name</tt> does not exist for an account and the total
<tt>amount</tt> of all updates for that <tt>name</tt> is positive,
create a new account for that name.
Print a message that there is a new account, with a name and amount.
</p><p>
If a <tt>name</tt> does not exist for an account and the total
<tt>amount</tt> of all updates for that <tt>name</tt> is zero or
negative, print a message that there is no account
and the name and amount, but otherwise ignore the update.
</p><p>

</p></li><li> Write a program
<tt>String [] mergearr(String [] x, String [] y)</tt> that will
merge two sorted arrays <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> to produce a
new array in ascending sorted order.  If there are duplicated items,
the duplicates should all appear in the output.
<p>

</p></li><li> Write a program <tt>boolean markup(Cons text)</tt> that will
check a text in a markup language (such as HTML or XML) to see
if it is well-formed.  The list <tt>text</tt> is a list of
<tt>String</tt>.  Some strings are markup tags, such as
<tt>"&lt;TT&gt;"</tt> or <tt>"&lt;/TT&gt;"</tt>,
and other strings are ignored for checking purposes.  You may
assume that any string that begins with <tt>&lt;</tt> is a tag.
Every opening tag should be matched by a closing tag, indicated by
<tt>/</tt> ; we will assume that tag pairs may be nested to a depth
up to 100.
<p>
If a list is well-formed, return <tt>true</tt>; if there is a
tag out of place, print a message with the offending tag, its
numeric position in the list (starting with 0), and the correct
tag that was expected, and return <tt>false</tt>.
