<h2>CS 314 Assignment 9: Memos and Drums</h2>

<h3>Due: November 21, 2012.</h3>

<b>Files:</b> <tt>Cons.java</tt> &nbsp; 
 <tt>Cons.jfugue.java</tt> &nbsp; <tt>Event.java</tt> &nbsp;
<tt>patmatch.lsp</tt> &nbsp; <tt>patterns.lsp</tt> &nbsp; <tt>patm.lsp</tt>

<p>
Some functions that you may need are provided in the file
<tt>Cons.java</tt>, and you will need some of your functions from the
last assignment.  Question 1 may be done in Java or in Lisp; the rest
should be done in Java.

</p><ol>

<p></p><li> Write a recursive function <tt>Object solve(Cons e, String v)</tt> that
solves the equation <tt>e</tt> for variable <tt>v</tt>,
which we assume occurs at most once in <tt>e</tt>.
<p>
This function does the same thing as the earlier version of
<tt>solve</tt>; in this version, use patterns to rewrite the given
expression.  The base cases are the same as before, and you
can copy your code for those cases.
</p><ol>
<li> If the left-hand side (lhs) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>, return <tt>e</tt>.
<pre>   (solve '(= f (* m a)) 'f)  =&gt;  (= f (* m a))
</pre>

</li><li> If the right-hand side (rhs) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>, return <tt>e</tt>
with its arguments reversed.
<pre>   (solve '(= (* m a) f) 'f)  =&gt;  (= f (* m a))
</pre>

</li><li> If the rhs is not <tt>v</tt> and not a Cons, return <tt>null</tt>.

<p></p></li><li> If the rhs of <tt>e</tt> is a Cons (i.e. an operation), try to
solve the equation by applying algebraic transformations from a list
of patterns, <tt>algpats</tt>.  For each pattern in the list, try
to <tt>transform</tt> the expression <tt>e</tt> using the pattern.
If the transformation works (is not <tt>null</tt>), call <tt>solve</tt>
recursively on the transformed version of <tt>e</tt>; if the result of
<tt>solve</tt> is not <tt>null</tt>,
return that result.  Otherwise, continue through the list of patterns.
If all patterns have been tried, return <tt>null</tt>.
</li></ol>
<p>
An initial list of patterns is provided; add patterns to complete the set.


</p><p></p></li><li> Write a method <tt>hashCode()</tt> for the class <tt>Cons</tt>.
The <tt>hashCode</tt> of a Cons should be the XOR of the
<tt>hashCode</tt> of the <tt>first</tt> times <tt>17</tt> and the
<tt>hashCode</tt> of the <tt>rest</tt> times <tt>127</tt>.
The <tt>hashCode</tt> of <tt>null</tt> should be 0; use an
auxiliary function to make sure that you do not try to call
<tt>hashCode()</tt> on <tt>null</tt>, which would cause a runtime
exception.


<p></p></li><li> Write a class <tt>Memoizer</tt> (in a file <tt>Memoizer.java</tt>)
that implements memoization of a function call.  Memoization is a
technique for wrapping an expensive function with a memory structure
that remembers previously computed values of the function.  If the
function is called again with the same argument value, it will be
cheaper to look up the saved value than to recompute it.
<p>
The class should be created using <tt>new Memoizer(Functor f)</tt>
where <tt>f</tt> is a functor that wraps the function associated
with the memoizer.
</p><p>
Use a <tt>HashMap</tt> within the <tt>Memoizer</tt> to associate
function values with argument values.  You can Google "java hashmap"
to get documentation of a <tt>HashMap</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt>Memoizer</tt> should have a method <tt>Object call(Object x)</tt>
to perform the wrapped function call.
The <tt>call</tt> method should operate as follows:
</p><ol>
<li> First, <tt>call</tt> should look up the parameter <tt>x</tt>
in the <tt>HashMap</tt>; if it is present, return the value associated
with <tt>x</tt> (without calling the <tt>Functor</tt>).

<p></p></li><li> Otherwise,
<ol><li> Call the <tt>Functor</tt> to compute the value of <tt>fn(x)</tt>.
    </li><li> Add the value <tt>fn(x)</tt> to the <tt>HashMap</tt> for the
     key <tt>x</tt>.
    </li><li> Return the value <tt>fn(x)</tt>.
</li></ol>
</li></ol>

</p><p></p></li><li> An Austin company is making a digital piano, drum and percussion
synthesizer, and they have hired you to write the software.  Since
musicians are not always good programmers, the input language
that is used to specify a music pattern needs to be simple.  The
software needs to convert the specified pattern into a time
sequence of I/O commands to drive the synthesizer units.
Since music is a language, we expect that a music program will be
structured as a tree.
<p>
The synthesizer driver program is implemented as a
discrete-event simulator, based on a <tt>PriorityQueue</tt>.
You can Google "java priorityqueue"
to get documentation of a <tt>PriorityQueue</tt>.
</p><p>
A discrete-event simulator processes a sequence of <i>events</i>
which are scheduled at particular clock times.  The
<tt>PriorityQueue</tt> is used to hold the pending events, with the
priority being the time at which an event is scheduled to occur.
In operation, the simulator removes the highest-priority
(smallest time value) event from the queue, sets the current time
to the time of the event, and executes it;
the event will typically perform some action, and it may schedule
other events for the future.  The simulation stops if the queue
becomes empty.
</p><p>
We will assume that time values are integers.  Events that occur
at the same integer time are considered to be simultaneous,
regardless of their order, since the computer is much faster
than the music output.  A time duration of 1 represents a 1/16
note duration.
</p><p>
An <tt>Event</tt> has a scheduled <tt>.time()</tt> and an
<tt>.action()</tt>; this class is provided.  An action is a list,
consisting of a command followed by parameters; usually there
is only one parameter, the length of time the command lasts.
An event is added to the queue by the call
<tt>addevent(PriorityQueue pq, Cons action, int time)</tt> .
</p><p>
Execution of a command
may emit an I/O command to the synthesizer.  Write a function
<tt> execute(PriorityQueue pq, Cons act, int time)</tt>
that executes an action by emitting appropriate commands.
</p><p>
The function <tt>emit(instrument, time, duration)</tt> sends
a command to an instrument; the arguments are all <tt>int</tt>.
The <tt>instrument</tt> values are as follows:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>[bass_drum]</td><td>boom</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>[acoustic_snare]</td><td>snare</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>[pedal_hi_hat]</td><td>hat</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>[crash_cymbal_1]</td><td>cymbal</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>[cowbell]</td><td>cowbell</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>[ride_bell]</td><td>bell</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>[hand_clap]</td><td>clap</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>[tambourine]</td><td>tambourine</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
Commands are as follows, with <tt>d</tt> representing the duration
of the action; usually a duration should be a power of 2,
except for <tt>rest</tt>.
</p><ul>
<li> <tt>(rest d)</tt> does not emit anything, but has a time
 duration of <tt>d</tt>.
</li><li> <tt>(boom d)</tt> emits a [bass_drum] (4) command.
</li><li> <tt>(snare d)</tt> emits a [acoustic_snare] (5) command.
</li><li> <tt>(hat d)</tt> emits a [pedal_hi_hat] (6) command.
</li><li> <tt>(cymbal d)</tt> emits a [crash_cymbal_1] (7) command.
</li><li> <tt>(cowbell d)</tt> emits a [cowbell] (8) command.
</li><li> <tt>(bell d)</tt> emits a [ride_bell] (9) command.
</li><li> <tt>(clap d)</tt> emits a [hand_clap] (10) command.
</li><li> <tt>(kaboom d)</tt> schedules <tt>(boom d/4)</tt> at
 <tt>d/4</tt> past the current time, and schedules
  <tt>(boom d/2)</tt> at <tt>d/2</tt> past the current time.
 Thus, <tt>(kaboom d)</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>(seq (rest d/4) (boom d/4) (boom d/2))</tt>.
</li><li> <tt>(tambourine d)</tt> multiplies its duration by a random number,
obtained by calling <tt>random.nextDouble()</tt> ;
if the integer result is &#8805; 2, it schedules <tt>tambourine</tt> again with
that amount as its duration, at the current time plus current duration
minus that amount.  It emits a [tambourine] (11) command with a
duration of 2 immediately.  (This random behavior simulates
a tambourine player who smokes way too much weed.)
</li><li> <tt>(seq action<sub>1</sub> ... action<sub>n</sub>)</tt> schedules each of its actions
to execute in sequence, one after the other.  <tt>seq</tt> thus makes a sequence
of multiple actions look like a single action.  <tt>seq</tt> could either
schedule all of its actions at once, starting with the current time
and adding the time of each action, or it could schedule the first
action and schedule a <tt>seq</tt> for the rest of the actions.
</li><li> <tt>(sync action<sub>1</sub> ... action<sub>n</sub>)</tt> schedules each of its actions
for the current time.  <tt>sync</tt>
represents synchronized execution of multiple subprograms.
</li><li> <tt>(repeat n action)</tt> schedules n events with the specified
action.  The first of these n events will happen at the same time
that repeat executes (i.e. simultaneously with repeat).  One way to
accomplish this is to schedule the action immediately;
then if n &gt; 1, schedule <tt>(repeat n-1 action)</tt> for the current
time plus the time of the action.  Alternatively, repeat could simply
schedule all n events at once; this would use more queue space if n
is large.
</li><li> <tt>(piano voice note d)</tt> emits a piano command using
the function <tt>emitp(voice, note, time, d)</tt>.
A <tt>note</tt> is a string such as "C".  A note may specify
an octave, such as "C5", and the note letter may be followed
 by "#" or "b"
for sharp and flat.  <tt>voice</tt> is an integer from 0 to 3.
</li></ul>
<p>
Examples:
</p><pre>(seq (boom 4) (bell 4))

(seq (repeat 2 (kaboom 4)) (repeat 3 (cymbal 2)))

(repeat 2 (seq (piano 0 C5 4) (piano 0 D5 4) (piano 0 E5 4)))
</pre>
<p>
It will be helpful to write the <tt>totaltime()</tt> function (below) first.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
Write a function <tt>int totaltime(Cons action)</tt> that calculates
the total time required for an action.  For most actions, the time is
simply the duration of the action.  A <tt>repeat</tt> action has a time
that is the repeat count times the time of the sub-action.
A <tt>seq</tt> action takes the sum of the times of its sub-actions.
A <tt>sync</tt> action takes the maximum time of its sub-actions.

<p>
</p></li><li> A <i>round</i> is "a musical composition in which two or more
voices sing exactly the same melody" [Wikipedia].  Write a function
<tt>Cons round( Cons melody )</tt> that will take a music program
and make a round out of it.  We will assume that a round is formed
by repeating the same melody with three different voices; the voice
is indicated in the input melody by the variable <tt>?i</tt> and
should be replaced by 0, 1, and 2 to form the three voices.
The second voice is delayed by 1/4 the length of the melody,
and the third voice is delayed by 1/2 the length of the melody.
</li></ol>
<p>
The jFugue system,
<a href="http://jfugue.org/"><tt>http://jfugue.org</tt></a>,
allows sounds
to be produced from Java.  An interface has been written to
allow the output of your program to produce sounds through
jFugue.  Your program will not be any different whether you use
jFugue or not; using jFugue may make debugging easier because
you can hear whether the music sounds right.
If you would like to use jFugue, download it from
the class directory or the jFugue site and install it in the same
directory that you use for your program.  Probably the easiest way
to install jFugue is to download the <tt>.jar</tt> file and unpack
it in the same directory with your program using
</p><pre>jar xf jfugue-4.0.3.jar
</pre>
Use the file <tt>Cons.jfugue.java</tt> and rename it to be <tt>Cons.java</tt> .
