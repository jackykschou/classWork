<h1> Programming Assignment 2 -- CS429 Spring 2013 </h1>
Due Date: 8 Feb 2013
<p>
The purpose of this assignment is mainly (a) to get you working
with binary representations of information, and (b) to start 
the work of writing a simulator for Y86 by loading a Y86 binary
into simulated memory.

</p><p>
Write a C program to read a 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~peterson/y86_format.html"> Y86 object file </a> into memory 
and then print, one byte per line, all non-zero bytes to
standard output, in the format:
</p><pre>[Byte Address, in hex]: [Byte Value, in hex].
</pre>

<p> For example, an input file of
</p><pre>79620000000430F40001
</pre>
would print
<pre>0000: 30
0001: F4
0003: 01
</pre>

<p> There are two types of errors that your program can report
instead of the output given above.
</p><ol>
<li> A file without the 0x7962 as the first two bytes should
just report "The file is not a Y86 object file".
</li><li> If the file has the 0x7962 as the first two bytes, but
does not match the expected format otherwise, just report
"The Y86 object file is corrupted".
</li></ol>
